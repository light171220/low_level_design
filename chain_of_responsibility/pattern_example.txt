Chain of Responsibility Pattern: Real-World Examples

The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that passes requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

Real-World Examples

1. ATM Cash Dispensers 
   When withdrawing money, the request passes through multiple handlers (dispensers) for different denominations. The $100 dispenser handles as many hundreds as possible, then passes the remaining amount to the $50 dispenser, which passes the remainder to the $20 dispenser, and so on.

2. Customer Support Escalation Systems 
   A customer request first goes to a level 1 support rep. If they can't resolve it, it gets escalated to a level 2 specialist, then to a supervisor, and potentially to engineering or management.

3. Approval Workflows
   In expense approval systems, small expenses might be approved by immediate managers, while larger ones get forwarded to directors, VPs, or the CFO depending on the amount.

4. Document Processing Pipelines
   In document management systems, a document might pass through validation, formatting, security scanning, versioning, and archiving handlers in sequence.

5. Network Packet Filtering
   Firewalls and security systems pass network packets through multiple filters, with each one checking different security aspects (IP validation, content inspection, rate limiting, etc.).

6. Credit Card Transaction Processing
   When you make a purchase, the transaction passes through fraud detection, available balance verification, merchant validation, and other processing steps.

7. Healthcare Diagnosis Systems
   Patient symptoms are evaluated by triage nurses, then general practitioners, and finally specialists if needed.

8. Input Validation in Web Forms
   Form data might go through required field validation, then format validation, then business rule validation, with each handler focusing on a specific validation aspect.
